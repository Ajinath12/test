Classes are created by keyword class.
Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute
Class Definition Syntax:

class ClassName:
    # Statement-1
    .
    .
    .
    # Statement-N


Class Objects
An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. 

Object_name=classname()


Python Method
A Python method is like a Python function, but it must be called on an object.

And to create it, you must put it inside a class.

Now in this Car class, we have five methods, namely, start(), halt(), drift(), speedup(), and turn().

In this example, we put the pass statement in each of these, because we haven’t decided what to do yet.

Let’s call the drift() Python method on blackverna.

What is a function in Python?
In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.

Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable.
